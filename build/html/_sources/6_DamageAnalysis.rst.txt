Damage analysis and quality rescaling of the BAM file
#####################################################

To authenticate our analysis we will assess the *post-mortem* damage of the reads aligned to the reference sequence. We can track the *post-portem* damage accumulated by DNA molecules in the form of fragmentation due to depurination and cytosine deamination, which generates the typical pattern of **C->T** and **G->A** variation at the 5'- and 3'-end of the DNA molecules. To assess the *post-mortem* damage patterns in our ``bam`` file we will use ``mapDamage``, which analyses the size distribution of the reads and the base composition of the genomic regions located up- and downstream of each read, generating various plots and summary tables. To start the analysis we need the final ``bam`` and the reference sequence: 
::

  mapDamage -i filename.final.sort.bam -r reference.fasta

``mapDamage`` creates a new folder where the output files are created. One of these files, is named ``Fragmisincorporation_plot.pdf`` which contains the following plots:

.. image:: images/damage.png

If DNA damage is detected, we can run ``mapDamage`` again using the ``--rescale-only`` option and providing the path to the results folder that has been created by the program (option ``-d``). This command will downscale the quality scores at positions likely affected by deamination according to their initial quality values, position in reads and damage patterns. 
A new rescaled ``bam`` file is then generated. 
::

  mapDamage -i filename.final.sort.bam -r reference.fasta --rescale-only -d results_folder


You can also rescale the ``bam`` file directly in the first command with the option ``--rescale``: 
::

  mapDamage -i filename.final.sort.bam -r reference.fasta --rescale

.. note::

  Another useful tool for estimating *post-mortem* damage (PMD) is `PMDTools`_. This program uses a model incorporating PMD, base quality scores and biological polymorphism to assign a PMD score to the reads. PMD > 0 indicates support for the sequence being genuinely ancient. PMDTools filters the damaged reads (based on the selected score) in a separate ``bam`` file which can be used for downstream analyses (e.g. variant call).

The rescaled ``bam`` file has to be indexed, as usual.
::

  samtools index filename.final.sort.rescaled.bam
