Metagenomic screening of shotgun data
#####################################

Kraken
******

In this hands-on session we will use `Kraken`_ to screen the metagenomic content of a DNA extract after shotgun sequencing. 
A Kraken database is a directory containing at least 4 files:

  - **database.kdb**: Contains the k-mer to taxon mappings
  - **database.idx**: Contains minimizer offset locations in database.kdb
  - **taxonomy/nodes.dmp**: Taxonomy tree structure + ranks
  - **taxonomy/names.dmp**: Taxonomy names


Minikraken
**********

We will first use a pre-built 8 GB Kraken database, called `Minikraken`_, constructed from complete dusted bacterial, archaeal, and viral genomes in RefSeq (as of October 2017).
You can download the pre-built Minikraken database from the website with ``wget``, and extract the archive content with ``tar``: 

  .. _Kraken: http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken/
  .. _Minikraken: https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken/

::

  wget https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken/dl/minikraken_20171101_8GB_dustmasked.tgz
  tar -xvzf minikraken_20171101_8GB_dustmasked.tgz

Then, we can run the taxonomic assignation of the reads in our sample with the ``kraken`` command
::

  kraken --db minikraken_20171101_8GB_dustmasked --fastq-input filename.gz --gzip-compressed --output filename.kraken



Some of the options available in Kraken:  

=======================  ========
Option                   Function
=======================  ========
**--db** <string>        Path to the folder (database name) containing the database files.  
**--output** <string>    Print output to filename.
**--threads** <integer>  Number of threads (only when multiple cores are used).
**--fasta-input**	     Input is FASTA format.
**--fastq-input**	     Input is FASTQ format.
**--gzip-compressed**    Input is gzip compressed.
=======================  ========


Create report files
******************* 

Once the taxonomic assignation is done, from the Kraken output file we create a report of the analysis by running the ``kraken-report`` script. Note that the database used must be the same as the one used to generate the output file in the command above. The output file is a tab-delimited file with the following fields, from left to right: 

  1. Percentage of reads covered by the clade rooted at this taxon
  2. Number of reads covered by the clade rooted at this taxon
  3. Number of reads assigned directly to this taxon
  4. A rank code, indicating (U)nclassified, (D)omain, (K)ingdom, (P)hylum, (C)lass, (O)rder, (F)amily, (G)enus, or (S)pecies. All other ranks are simply '-'.
  5. NCBI taxonomy ID
  6. Indented scientific name

Notice that we will have to redirect the output to a file with ``>``.
::

  kraken-report --db Minikraken filename.kraken > filename.kraken.report
 
.. note:: We can use a ``for`` loop to make the taxonomic assignation and create the report file for multiple samples. Notice the assignation of variables ``filename`` and ``fname`` to return output files named after the sample. 
  ::

    for i in *.fastq
    do 
      filename=$(basename "$i")
      fname="${filename%.fastq}"
      kraken --db Minikraken --threads 4 --fastq-input $i --output /${fname}.kraken
      kraken-report --db Minikraken ${fname}.kraken > ${fname}.kraken.report
    done


Visualization of data with Krona
******************************** 

Finally, we can visualize the results of the Kraken analysis with `Krona`_, which disaplys hierarchical data (like taxonomic assignation) in multi-layerd pie charts. 
The interactive charts created by Krona are in the ``html`` format and can be viewed with any web browser. 
We will convert the kraken output in html format using the program ``ktImportTaxonomy``, which parses the information relative to the query ID and the taxonomy ID. 

  .. _Krona: https://github.com/marbl/Krona/wiki

::
  
  ktImportTaxonomy -q 2 -t 3 filename.kraken -o filename.kraken.html

Some of the options available in ktImportTaxonomy:

================ ========
Option           Function
================ ========
**-q** <integer> Column of input files to use as query ID.
**-t** <integer> Column of input files to use as taxonomy ID.
**-o** <string>  Output file name.
================ ========

.. note:: If you want to analyze multiple kraken files from various samples you view the results in one single html file running ``ktImportTaxonomy`` as follows:
  ::
    
    ktImportTaxonomy -q 2 -t 3 filename_1.kraken filename_2.kraken ... filename_n.kraken -o all_samples.kraken.html


.. image:: images/krona.png


Building a Kraken standard database (on HPC clusters) 
*****************************************************

The pre-built Minikraken database is useful for a quick metagenomic screening of shotgun data. However, by building larger databases (i.e. a larger set of k-mers gathered) we may increase the sensitivity of the analysis. 
One option is to build the Kraken standard database. To create this database we use the command ``kraken-build``, which downlads the ``RefSeq`` complete genomes for the bacterial, archaeal, and viral domains, and builds the database. 
::

  kraken-build --standard --db standardkraken.folder

.. note:: 
  - Usage of the database will require users to keep only the ``database.idx``, ``database.kdb``, ``taxonomy/nodes.dmp`` and ``taxonomy/names.dmp`` files. 
    During the database building process some intermediate file are created that may be removed afterwards with the command: 
    ::
    
      kraken-build --db standardkraken.folder --clean

  - The downloaded RefSeq genomes require 33GB of disk space. The build process will then require approximately 450GB of additional disk space. The final ``database.idx``, ``database.kdb``, and ``taxonomy/`` files require 200 Gb of disk space, and running one sample against such database requires 175 Gb of RAM. 


Building a Kraken custom database (on HPC clusters)
*************************************************** 

Building kraken custum databases is computationally intensive. You will find a ready to use database. 
Kraken also allows creation of customized databases, where we can choose which sequences to include and the final size of the database. For example if you do not have the computational resources to build and run analyses with a full database of bacterial genomes (or you don't need to), you may want to build a custom database with only the genomes needed for your application. 

1. First of all we choose a name for our database and we create a folder with that name using ``mkdir``. Let's call the database ``CustomDB``. This will be the name used in all the dollowing commands after the ``--db`` option. 

2. Download NCBI taxonomy files (the sequence ID to taxon map, the taxonomic names and tree information) with ``kraken-build --download-taxonomy``. 
   The taxonomy files are necessary to associate a taxon to the sequence identifier (the GI number in NCBI) of the ``fasta`` sequences composing our database. For this reason we will build our database only with sequences from the NCBI RefSeq. 
   For more information on the NCBI taxonomy visit click `here`_. This command will create a sub-folder ``taxonomy/`` inside our CustomDB folder:  
   
     .. _here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi. 
   
   ::
   
     kraken-build --download-taxonomy --threads 4 --db CustomDB
   

3. Install a genomic library. RefSeq genomes in fasta file from five standard groups are made easily available in Kraken with the command **kraken-build --download-library**:

  - *bacteria* : RefSeq complete bacterial genomes
  - *archaea* : RefSeq complete archaeal genomes
  - *plasmid* : RefSeq plasmid sequences
  - *viral* : RefSeq complete viral genomes
  - *human* : GRCh38 human genome

  The following command will download all the RefSeq bacterial genomes (33Gb size) and create a folder ``library/`` with a sub-folder ``bacteria/`` inside your CustomDB folder:  
  ::

    kraken-build --download-library bacteria --threads 4 --db CustomDB

4. We can add any sort of RefSeq ``fasta`` sequences to the library with ``kraken-build --add-to-library``. For example we will add to the library of bacterial genomes the RefSeq sequences of mitochodrial genomes. The sequences will be inside the sub-folder ``added/``.
   ::
   
     kraken-build --add-to-library mitochondrion.1.1.genomic.fna --threads 4 --db CustomDB
     kraken-build --add-to-library mitochondrion.2.1.genomic.fna --threads 4 --db CustomDB

   .. note:: If you have several ``fasta`` files to add you can use a ``for`` loop: 
     ::  

       for i in *.fasta
       do
         kraken-build --add-to-library $i --threads 4 --db CustomDB
       done

         
5. When analyzing a metagenomics sample using a ``Kraken`` database the primary source of false positive hits is represented by low-complexity sequences in the genomes themselves (e.g., a string of 31 or more consecutive A's). 
   For this reason, once gathered all the genomes that we want to use for our custom database, low-complexity regions have to be 'dusted'. 
   The program ``dustmasker`` from `Blast+`_ identifies low-complexity regions and **soft-mask** them (the corresponding sequence is turned to lower-case letters). 
   With a ``for`` loop we run dustmasker on each ``fasta`` file present in the library folder, and we will pipe (``|``) to dustmasker a ``sed`` command to replace the low-complexity regions (lower-case) with Ns. 
   Notice that the output is redirected (``>``) to a temporary file, which is afterwards renamed to replace the original file ``fasta`` file with the command ``mv``.
   
     .. _Blast+: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279681/
   
   ::
	
     for i in `find CustomDB/library \( -name '*.fna' -o -name '*.ffn' \)`
     do
       dustmasker -in $i -infmt fasta -outfmt fasta | sed -e '/>/!s/a\|c\|g\|t/N/g' > tempfile
       mv -f tempfile $i
     done

 
  Some of the options available in Dustmasker: 

  ===================== ========
  Option                Function
  ===================== ========
  **-in** <string>      input file name  
  **-infmt** <string>   input format (e.g. fasta)  
  **-outfmt8** <string> output format (fasta)
  ===================== ========
      
 
6. Finally, we build the database with ``kraken-build``. With this command, Kraken uses all the masked genomes contained in the library (bacteria and mtDNA RefSeq) to create a database of 31 bp-long k-mers. 
   We can choose the size of our custom database (hence the number of k-mers included, and the sensitivity) with the  ``--max-db-size`` option (8 Gb here). 
   ::
   
     kraken-build --build --max-db-size 8 --db CustomDB


Taxonomic assignation with Kraken custom database
************************************************* 

Once our custom database is built we can run the command for taxonomic assignation of DNA reads agaisnt the custom database, as in section 1.1 and 1.2. 
::

  kraken --db CustomDB --fastq-input merged.fastq.gz --gzip-compressed --output sample.kraken
  kraken-report --db CustomDB sample.kraken > sample.kraken.report


Or, again, we can loop the commands if we have various samples. 
::

  for i in *.fastq
  do 
    filename=$(basename "$i")
    fname="${filename%.fastq}"
    kraken --db CustomDB --threads 4 --fastq-input $i --output ${fname}.kraken
    kraken-report --db CustomDB ${fname}.kraken > ${fname}.kraken.report
  done


Finally, we can visualize the results of the Kraken analysis with ``Krona``. Run ``ktImportTaxonomy`` to generate the ``html`` file and open it in a web browser to notice the difference with the analysis done with Minikraken. 
::

  ktImportTaxonomy -q 2 -t 3 sample.kraken -o sample.kraken.html
  
  
*******
Kraken2
*******

The first version of Kraken use a large indexed and sorted list of k-mer/LCA pairs as its database, which may be problematic for users due to the large memory requirements. For this reason `Kraken 2`_ was developed.
Kraken 2 is fast and requires less memory, BUT the database false positive errors occur in less than 1% of queries (confidence scoring thresholds can be used to call out to detect them).
The default (or standard) database size is 29 GB (as of Jan. 2018, in Kraken 1 the standard database is about 200 GB!), and you will need slightly more than that in RAM if you want to build it.
By default, Kraken 2 will attempt to use the dustmasker or  segmasker programs provided as part of NCBI's BLAST suite to mask low-complexity regions.

A Kraken 2 database is a directory containing at least 3 files:

  - **hash.k2d**: Contains the minimizer to taxon mappings
  - **opts.k2d**: Contains information about the options used to build the database
  - **taxo.k2d**: Contains taxonomy information used to build the database
  
Other files may also be present as part of the database build process, and can, if desired, be removed after a successful build of the database.

Minikraken2
***********
You can download the pre-built `Minikraken2`_ database (containing bacteria, viral and archaea sequences) from the website with ``wget``, and extract the archive content with ``tar``: 

  .. _Minikraken2: https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/index.shtml?t=downloads

::

  wget ftp://ftp.ccb.jhu.edu/pub/data/kraken2_dbs/minikraken2_v1_8GB_201904_UPDATE.tgz
  tar -xvzf minikraken2_v1_8GB_201904_UPDATE.tgz

To classify the reads in a ``fastq`` file against the Minikraken2 database, you can run this command: 
::
  
  kraken2 --db minikraken2_v1_8GB filename.fastq.gz --gzip-compressed --output filename.kraken --report filename.kraken.report
  
Some of the options available in Kraken 2: 

====================== =====================================================
Option                 Function
====================== =====================================================
**--use-names**        Print scientific names instead of just taxids
**--gzip-compressed**  Input is gzip compressed  
**--report** <string>  Print a report with aggregrate counts/clade to file
**--threads**          Number of threads (default: 1)
====================== =====================================================

.. note:: 

  - In Kraken 2 you can generate the reports file by typing the ``--report`` option (followed by a name for the report file to generate) in the command used for the classification. In Kraken 1, report files are generated with a specific command, after the classification (section 3.1.2: `Create report files`_). 
  - In order to run later Krona, the Kraken output file must contain taxids, and not scientific names. So if you want to run Krona do not call the option ``--use-names``.
  

The Kraken 2 report format, like Kraken 1, is tab-delimited with one line per taxon. There are six fields, from left to right: 

  1. Percentage of fragments covered by the clade rooted at this taxon
  2. Number of fragments covered by the clade rooted at this taxon
  3. Number of fragments assigned directly to this taxon
  4. A rank code, indicating (U)nclassified, (R)oot, (D)omain, (K)ingdom,
     (P)hylum, (C)lass, (O)rder, (F)amily, (G)enus, or (S)pecies.
     Taxa that are not at any of these 10 ranks have a rank code that is
     formed by using the rank code of the closest ancestor rank with
     a number indicating the distance from that rank.  E.g., "G2" is a
     rank code indicating a taxon is between genus and species and the
     grandparent taxon is at the genus rank.
  5. NCBI taxonomic ID number
  6. Indented scientific name

To visualize the results of the classification in multi-layerd pie charts, use ``Krona``, as described in the section 3.1.3: `Visualization of data with Krona`_


Kraken 2 Custom Database
************************

We have already created a custom database to use in this hands-on session so we can go straight to the classification (step 4). However, we report here all the commands to build a Kraken2 database (steps 1-3). 

1. The first step is to create a new folder that will contain your custom database (choose an appropriate name for the folder-database, here we will call it ``CustomDB``). 
   Then we have to install a taxonomy. Usually, you will use the NCBI taxonomy. The following command will download in the folder ``/taxonomy`` the accession number to taxon maps, as well as the taxonomic name and tree information from NCBI:
   ::
   
     kraken2-build --download-taxonomy --db CustomDB

2. Install one or more reference libraries. Several sets of standard genomes (or proteins) are available, which are constantly updated (see also the Kraken `website`_).

     .. _website: https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/index.shtml?t=manual#installation)
   
     - archaea: RefSeq complete archaeal genomes/proteins
     - bacteria: RefSeq complete bacterial genomes/proteins
     - plasmid: RefSeq plasmid nucleotide/protein sequences
     - viral: RefSeq complete viral genomes/proteins
     - human: GRCh38 human genome/proteins
     - fungi: RefSeq complete fungal genomes/proteins
     - plant: RefSeq complete plant genomes/proteins
     - protozoa: RefSeq complete protozoan genomes/proteins
     - nr: NCBI non-redundant protein database
     - nt: NCBI non-redundant nucleotide database
     - env_nr: NCBI non-redundant protein database with sequences from large environmental sequencing projects
     - env_nt: NCBI non-redundant nucleotide database with sequences from large environmental sequencing projects
     - UniVec: NCBI-supplied database of vector, adapter, linker, and primer sequences that may be contaminating sequencing projects and/or assemblies
     - UniVec_Core: A subset of UniVec chosen to minimize false positive hits to the vector database
   
   You can select as many libraries as you want and run the following command, which will download the reference sequences in the folder ``/library``, as follows:
   ::
   
     kraken2-build --download-library bacteria --db CustomDB
     kraken2-build --download-library viral --db CustomDB
     kraken2-build --download-library plasmid --db CustomDB
     kraken2-build --download-library fungi --db CustomDB
   
   In a custom database, you can add as many ``fasta`` sequences as you like. For exmaple, you can download the organelle genomes in ``fasta`` files from the `RefSeq`_ website with the commands ``wget``:
   
     .. _RefSeq: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/organelle/ 
   
   ::
   
     wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/mitochondrion/mitochondrion.1.1.genomic.fna.gz
     wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/mitochondrion/mitochondrion.2.1.genomic.fna.gz

   The downloaded files are in compressed in the ``gz`` format. To unzip them run the ``gunzip`` command:
   ::
     
     gunzip mitochondrion.1.1.genomic.fna.gz
     gunzip mitochondrion.2.1.genomic.fna.gz
   
   Then you can add the ``fasta`` files to your library, as follows:
   ::
   
     kraken2-build --add-to-library mitochondrion.1.1.genomic.fna --db CustomDB
     kraken2-build --add-to-library mitochondrion.2.1.genomic.fna --db CustomDB
  
3. Once your library is finalized, you need to build the database (here we set a maximum database size of 8 GB (you must indicate it in bytes!) with the ``--max-db-size`` option). 
   ::
     
     kraken2-build --build --max-db-size 8000000000 --db CustomDB
   
   .. warning::
   
     Kraken 2 uses two programs to perform low-complexity sequence masking, both available from NCBI: ``dustmasker``, for nucleotide sequences, and  ``segmasker``, for amino acid sequences. 
     These programs are available as part of the NCBI BLAST+ suite. If these programs are not installed on the local system and in the user's PATH when trying to use ``kraken2-build``, the database build will fail. 
     Users who do not wish to install these programs can use the ``--no-masking`` option to kraken2-build in conjunction with any of the ``--download-library``, ``--add-to-library``, or ``--standard`` options; use of the ``--no-masking`` option will skip masking of low-complexity sequences during the build of the Kraken 2 database.
   
   
   The ``kraken2-inspect`` script allows users to gain information about the content of a Kraken 2 database. You can pipe the command to ``head``, or ``less``.
   ::
     
     kraken2-inspect --db path/to/dbfolder | head -5
  
4. Finally, we can run the classification of the reads against the custom database with the ``kraken2`` command:
   ::
     
     kraken2 --db CustomDB filename.fastq.gz --gzip-compressed --output filename.kraken --report filename.report

5. To visualize the results of the classification in multi-layerd pie charts, use ``Krona``, as described in the section 3.1.3: `Visualization of data with Krona`_


.. note::

  Recently, a novel metagenomics classifier, `KrakenUniq`_, has been developed to reduce false-positive identifications in metagenomic classification.
  KrakenUniq combines the fast k-mer-based classification of Kraken with an efficient algorithm for assessing the coverage of unique k-mers found in each species in a dataset. 
  On various test datasets, KrakenUniq gives better recall and precision than other methods and effectively classifies and distinguishes pathogens with low abundance from false positives in infectious disease samples.
