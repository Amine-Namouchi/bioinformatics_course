Alignment of reads to a reference genome
########################################

The metagenomic screenig of the shotgun library detected reads assigned to *Yersinia pestis*. The following step is to ascertain that these molecules are authentic. 
You can do that by mapping your pre-processed ``fastq`` files (merged and trimmed) to the *Yersinia pestis* CO92 strain reference sequence, available in the `RefSeq NCBI`_ database.
Here, in order to obtain an optimal coverage for the subsequent variant call, we will run the alignment on a different ``fastq`` file that we prepared to simulate an enriched library.

*************************************
Preparation of the reference sequence
*************************************


Index the reference sequence with bwa
*************************************
To align the reads to the reference sequence we will use the program `BWA`_, in particular the ``BWA aln`` algorithm. BWA first needs to construct the **FM-index** for the reference genome, with the command ``BWA index``. FM-indexing in Burrows-Wheeler transform is used to efficiently find the number of occurrences of a pattern within a compressed text, as well as locate the position of each occurrence. It is an essential step for querying the DNA reads to the reference sequence. This command generates five files with different extensions: ``amb``, ``ann``, ``bwt``, ``pac``, ``sa``.

  .. _BWA: https://github.com/lh3/bwa

::
     
  bwa index -a is reference.fasta
     
.. note::
  
  The option ``-a`` indicates the algorithm to use for constructing the index. For genomes smaller than < 2 Gb use the ``is`` algorithm. For larger genomes (>2 Gb), use the ``bwtsw`` algorithm. 	


Create a reference dictionary
*****************************
A dictionary file (``dict``) is necessary to run later in the pipeline ``GATK RealignerTargetCreator``. A sequence dictionary contains the sequence name, sequence length, genome assembly identifier, and other information about the sequences. To create the ``dict`` file we use `Picard`_. 

  .. _Picard: https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/

::

  picard CreateSequenceDictionary R= referece.fasta O= reference.dict
 
.. note:: In our server environment we can call Picard just by typing the program name. In other environments (including your laptop) you may have to call Picard by providing the full path to the java file ``jar`` of the program:
   ::
  
     java -jar /path/to/picard.jar CreateSequenceDictionary R= referece.fasta O= ref.dict


Index the reference sequence with Samtools
******************************************

The reference sequence has to be indexed in order to run later in the pipeline ``GATK IndelRealigner``. To do that, we will use `Samtools`_, in particular the tool ``samtools faidx``, which enables efficient access to arbitrary regions within the reference sequence. The index file typically has the same filename as the corresponding reference sequece, with the extension ``fai`` appended.

  .. _Samtools: http://www.htslib.org/

::

  samtools faidx reference.fasta


************************************************
Alignment of the reads to the reference sequence
************************************************

Alignment of pre-processed reads to the reference genome with BWA aln
*********************************************************************

To align the reads to the reference genome we will use ``BWA aln``, which supports an end-to-end alignment of reads to the reference sequence. The alternative algorithm, ``BWA mem`` supports also local (portion of the reads) and chimeric alignments (resulting in a larger number of mapped reads than ``BWA aln``). ``BWA aln`` is more suitable for aliging short reads, like expected for ancient DNA samples. The following comand will generate a ``sai`` file.
::

  bwa aln reference.fasta filename.fastq.gz -n 0.1 -l 1000 > filename.sai

Some of the options available in ``BWA aln``: 

================ ========
Option           Function
================ ========
**-n** *number*  Maximum edit distance if the value is an *integer*. If the value is *float* the edit distance is automatically chosen for different read lengths (default=0.04)
**-l** *integer* Seed length. If the value is larger than the query sequence, seeding will be disabled. 
**-o** *integer* Maximum number of gap opens. For aDNA, tolerating more gaps helps mapping more reads (default=1).
================ ========

.. note::

  - Due to the particular damaged nature of ancient DNA molecules, carrying deaminations at the molecules ends, we deactivate the ``seed-length`` option by giving it a high value (e.g. ``-l 1000``). 
  - Here we are aligning reads to a bacterial reference genome. To reduce the impact of spurious alignemnts due to presence bacterial species closely related to the one that we are investigating, we will adopt stringent conditions by decreasing the ``maximum edit distance`` option (``-n 0.1``). For alignment of DNA reads to the human reference sequence, less stringent conditions can be used (``-n 0.01`` and ``-o 2``). 


Once obtained the ``sai`` file, we align the reads (``fastq`` file) to the reference (``fasta`` file) using ``BWA samse``, to generate the alignment file ``sam``.
::

  bwa samse reference.fasta filename.sai filename.fastq.gz -f filename.sam


Converting sam file to bam file
*******************************

For the downstream analyses we will work with the binary (more compact) version of the ``sam`` file, called ``bam``. To convert the ``sam`` file in ``bam`` we will use ``Samtools view``. 
::

  samtools view -Sb filename.sam > filename.bam

.. note::

  The conversion from ``sam`` to ``bam`` can be piped (``|``) in one command right after the alignment step:
  ::

    bwa samse reference.fasta filename.sai filename.fastq.gz | samtools view -Sb - > filename.bam

To view the content of a ``sam`` file we can just use standard commands like ``head``, ``tail``, ``less``, while to view the content of a ``bam`` file (binary format of ``sam``) we have to use ``Samtools view``:
::

  samtools view filename.bam
  
You may want to display on the screen one read/line (scrolling with the spacebar):
::

  samtools view filename.bam | less -S

while to display just the header of the ``bam`` file:
:: 

  samtools view -H filename.bam


Sorting and indexing the bam file
*********************************

To go on with the analysis, we have to sort the reads aligned in the ``bam`` file by leftmost coordinates (or by read name when the option ``-n`` is used) with ``Samtools sort``. The option ``-o`` is used to provide an output file name:
::

  samtools sort filename.bam -o filename.sort.bam

The sorted bam files are then indexed with ``Samtools index``. Indexes allow other programs to retrieve specific parts of the ``bam`` file without reading through each sequence. The following command generates a ``bai`` file, a companion file of the ``bam`` which contains the indexes:
::

  samtools index filename.sort.bam


Adding Read Group tags and indexing bam files
*********************************************

A number of predefined tags may be appropriately assigned to specific set of reads in order to distinguish samples, libraries and other technical features. To do that we will use Picard. You may want to use ``RGLB`` (library ID) and ``RGSM`` (sample ID) tags at your own convenience based on the experimental design. Remember to call Picard from the path of the ``jar`` file.
::

  picard AddOrReplaceReadGroups INPUT= filename.sort.bam OUTPUT= filename.RG.bam RGID=rg_id RGLB=lib_id RGPL=platform RGPU=plat_unit RGSM=sam_id VALIDATION_STRINGENCY=LENIENT

.. note::

  - In some instances, Picard may stop running and return error messages due to conflicts with ``sam`` specifications produced by ``BWA`` (e.g. "MAPQ should be 0 for unmapped reads"). To suppress this error and allow Picard to continue, we pass the ``VALIDATION_STRINGENCY=LENIENT`` options (default is ``STRICT``).
  - Read Groups may be also added during the alignment with ``BWA`` using the option ``-R``. 

Once added the Read Group tags, we index again the bam file:
:: 

  samtools index filename.RG.bam


Marking and removing duplicates
*******************************
Amplification through PCR of genomic libraries leads to duplication formation, hence reads originating from a single fragment of DNA. The ``MarkDuplicates`` tool of Picard marks the reads as duplicates when the 5'-end positions of both reads and read-pairs match. A metric file with various statistics is created, and reads are removed from the bam file by using the ``REMOVE_DUPLICATES=True`` option (the default option is ``False``, which simply 'marks' duplicate reads keep them in the ``bam`` file).
:: 

  picard MarkDuplicates I= filename.RG.bam O= filename.DR.bam M=output_metrics.txt REMOVE_DUPLICATES=True VALIDATION_STRINGENCY=LENIENT &> logFile.log

Once removed the duplicates, we index again the bam file:
::

  samtools index filename.DR.bam


Local realignment of reads
**************************
The presence of insertions or deletions (indels) in the genome may be responsible of misalignments and bases mismatches that are easily mistaken as SNPs. For this reason, we locally realign reads to minimize the number of mispatches around the indels. The realignment process is done in two steps using two different tools of GATK called with the -T option. We first detect the intervals which need to be realigned with the ``GATK RealignerTargetCreator``, and save the list of these intevals in a file that we name ``target.intervals``:
::

  gatk -T RealignerTargetCreator -R reference.fasta -I filename.DR.bam -o target.intervals

.. note::

  Like Picard, in some server environment you can call GATK just by typing the program name. In other environments (also in this server) you have to call GATK by providing the full path to the java ``jar`` file. Here, the absolute path to the file is ``~/Share/Paleogenomics/programs/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar``:
  ::

    java -jar ~/Share/Paleogenomics/programs/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar -T RealignerTargetCreator -h

.. warning::
  
  In  *version 4* of GATK the indel realigment tools have been retired from the best practices (they are unnecessary if you are using an assembly based caller like **Mutect2** or **HaplotypeCaller**). To use the indel realignment tools make sure to install *version 3* of GATK.  

Then, we realign the reads over the intervals listed in the ``target.intervals`` file with the option ``-targetIntervals`` of the tool ``IndelRealigner`` in GATK:
::

  java -jar ~/Share/Paleogenomics/programs/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar	 -T IndelRealigner -R reference.fasta -I filename.RG.DR.bam -targetIntervals target.intervals -o filename.final.bam --filter_bases_not_stored

.. note::

  - If you want, you can redirect the standard output of the command into a ``log`` file by typing at the end of the command ``&> logFile.log`` 
  - The option ``--filter_bases_not_stored`` is used to filter out reads with no stored bases (i.e. with * where the sequence should be), instead of failing with an error

The final ``bam`` file has to be sorted and indexed as previously done:
::

    samtools sort filename.final.bam -o filename.final.sort.bam
    samtools index filename.final.sort.bam

Generate flagstat file
**********************

We can generate a file with useful information about our alignment with ``Samtools flagstat``. This file is a final summary report of the bitwise ``FLAG`` fields assigned to the reads in the ``sam`` file.
::

  samtools flagstat filename.final.sort.bam > flagstat_filename.txt

.. note::

  - You could generate a flagstat file for the two ``bam`` files before and after refinement and see the differences. 
  - You can decode each ``FLAG`` field assigned to a read on the `Broad Institute`_ website.
   
      .. _Broad Institute: https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html


Visualization of reads alignment
********************************

Once generated the final ``bam`` file,  you can compare the ``bam`` files before and after the refinement and polishing process (duplicates removal, realignment around indels and sorting). To do so, we will use the program ``IGV``, in which we will first load the reference fasta file from *Genomes --> Load genome from file* and then we will add one (or more) bam files with *File --> Load from file*:

.. image:: images/igv-bam_bam.png


******************************
Create mapping summary reports
******************************

We will use ``Qualimap`` to create summary reports from the generated ``bam`` files. As mentioned in the website, ``Qualimap`` examines sequencing alignment data in ``sam/bam`` files according to the features of the mapped reads and provides an overall view of the data that helps to detect biases in the sequencing and/or mapping of the data and eases decision-making for further analysis. 
::

  qualimap bamqc -c -bam input.bam 

Here are some screenshots of the outputs:

.. image:: images/qualimap.png


At this stage we have created different type of summary report using ``FastQC`` and ``Qualimap``. To create a unique summary that integrate and compare all the generated reports, we will use ``MultiQC``. If all the reports are in the same directory and its sub-directories, you can run ``MultiQC`` as follows: 
::

  multiqc . 

A list of programs that generate output files recognized by ``MultiQC`` are availble here: https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC 

Multiqc will create a summary report in ``html`` format that will let you compare all the summary reports for each of your samples:

.. image:: images/multiqc.png


*****************************************************
Damage analysis and quality rescaling of the BAM file
*****************************************************

To authenticate our analysis we will assess the *post-mortem* damage of the reads aligned to the reference sequence. We can track the *post-portem* damage accumulated by DNA molecules in the form of fragmentation due to depurination and cytosine deamination, which generates the typical pattern of **C->T** and **G->A** variation at the 5'- and 3'-end of the DNA molecules. To assess the *post-mortem* damage patterns in our ``bam`` file we will use ``mapDamage``, which analyses the size distribution of the reads and the base composition of the genomic regions located up- and downstream of each read, generating various plots and summary tables. To start the analysis we need the final ``bam`` and the reference sequence: 
::

  mapDamage -i filename.final.sort.bam -r reference.fasta

``mapDamage`` creates a new folder where the output files are created. One of these files, is named ``Fragmisincorporation_plot.pdf`` which contains the following plots:

.. image:: images/damage.png

If DNA damage is detected, we can run ``mapDamage`` again using the ``--rescale-only`` option and providing the path to the results folder that has been created by the program (option ``-d``). This command will downscale the quality scores at positions likely affected by deamination according to their initial quality values, position in reads and damage patterns. 
A new rescaled ``bam`` file is then generated. 
::

  mapDamage -i filename.final.sort.bam -r reference.fasta --rescale-only -d results_folder


You can also rescale the ``bam`` file directly in the first command with the option ``--rescale``: 
::

  mapDamage -i filename.final.sort.bam -r reference.fasta --rescale

.. note::

  Another useful tool for estimating *post-mortem* damage (PMD) is `PMDTools`_. This program uses a model incorporating PMD, base quality scores and biological polymorphism to assign a PMD score to the reads. PMD > 0 indicates support for the sequence being genuinely ancient. PMDTools filters the damaged reads (based on the selected score) in a separate ``bam`` file which can be used for downstream analyses (e.g. variant call).
  
  .. _PMDTools: https://github.com/pontussk/PMDtools

The rescaled ``bam`` file has to be indexed, as usual.
::

  samtools index filename.final.sort.rescaled.bam


*****************************************************
Edit Distance
*****************************************************

The edit distance defines the number of nucleotide changes that have to be made to one read sequence for it to be identical to the reference sequence.
To be more confident about the quality and authenticity of your sequencing data, you need to align your reads againt your reference sequence and the genome of a closely related species. 
Here we will align our ``fastq`` file against the `Yersinia pseudotuberculosis`_ genome, following all the steps from 4.1 to 4.4.
The edit distance must be lower when aligning the reads to the reference sequence compared to the closely related species.

  .. _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term=Yersinia+pseudotuberculosis

.. image:: images/EditDistance.png

To calculate the edit distance we will use `BAMStats`_, a tool for summarising Next Generation Sequencing alignments. The commands to generate summary-charts, including the edit distance is:

  .. _BAMStats: http://bamstats.sourceforge.net/

:: 
  
  BAMStats -i filename.rescaled.bam -v html -d -q -o outfile.html
   
=========================== ========
Option                      Function
=========================== ========
**-i** *filename*           SAM or BAM input file (must be sorted).
**-v** *html/simple*        View option for output format (currently accepts 'simple' or 'html'; default, simple). 
**-d**                      If selected, edit distance statistics will also be displayed as a separate table (optional).
**-q**                      If selected, mapping quality (MAPQ) statistics will also be displayed as a separate table (optional).
