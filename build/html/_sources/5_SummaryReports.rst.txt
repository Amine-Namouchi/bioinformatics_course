Create Summary Reports
######################

We will use ``Qualimap`` to create summary reports from the generated ``bam`` files. As mentioned in the website, ``Qualimap`` examines sequencing alignment data in ``sam/bam`` files according to the features of the mapped reads and provides an overall view of the data that helps to detect biases in the sequencing and/or mapping of the data and eases decision-making for further analysis. 
::

  qualimap bamqc -c -bam input.bam 

Here are some screenshots of the outputs:

At this stage we have created different type of summary report using ``FastQC`` and ``Qualimap``. To create a unique summary that integrate and compare all the generated reports, we will use ``MultiQC``. If all the reports are in the same directory and its sub-directories, you can run ``MultiQC`` as follows: 
::

  multiqc . 

A list of programs that generate output files recognized by ``MultiQC`` are availble here: https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC 

Multiqc will create a summary report in ``html`` format that will let you compare all the summary reports for each of your samples:
