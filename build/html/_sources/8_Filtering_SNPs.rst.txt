Filtering, annotating and combining SNPs
########################################

To investigate the genetic variants in the ``vcf`` files we will use the program `snpToolkit`_. 
The ``-h`` option will display the following message:

  .. _snpToolkit: https://github.com/Amine-Namouchi/snpToolkit

::

  snpToolkit -h
  
  positional arguments:
    {annotate,combine}  commands
      annotate          Please provide one or multiple vcf files
      combine           combine snpToolkit output files in one alignment in fasta format


Two options are possible: ``annotate`` or ``combine``. 

***************************
SNPs filtering and annotion
***************************

The ``snpToolkit annotate`` command will display general information about the usage of the program:

::

  snpToolkit annotate
  
  usage: snpToolkit annotate [-h] -i IDENTIFIER -g GENBANK
                                [-f EXCLUDECLOSESNPS] [-q QUALITY] [-d DEPTH]
                                [-r RATIO] [-e EXCLUDE] [--plot]
  
  optional arguments:
    -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  
  snpToolkit annotate required options:
    -i IDENTIFIER        provide a specific identifier to recognize the file(s)
                         to be analyzed
    -g GENBANK           Please provide a genbank file 
  
  snpToolkit annotate additional options:
    -f EXCLUDECLOSESNPS  exclude SNPs if the distance between them is lower then
                         the specified window size in bp
    -q QUALITY           quality score to consider as a cutoff for variant
                         calling. default value [20]
    -d DEPTH             minimum depth caverage. default value [3]
    -r RATIO             minimum ratio that correspond to the number of reads
                         that has the mutated allele / total depth in that
                         particular position. default value [0]
    -e EXCLUDE           provide a tab file with genomic regions to exclude in
                         this format: region1 start stop


Here is a simple example on how to use snpToolkit:
::

  snpToolkit annotate -i VCF-filename.vcf.gz -g genbankFile.gbff -q 30 -d 5 -r 0.9


snpToolkit can automatically recogninze ``vcf`` files generated with the following programs: ``samtools mpileup``, ``gatk HaplotyCaller`` and ``freeBayes``. The ``vcf`` files could be gzipped or not. In the command line above, snpToolkit will filter and annotate all SNPs in the ``vcf`` file(s) that fullfil the following criteria: ``quality >= 30``, ``depth of coverage >= 5`` and ``ratio >= 0.9``.

.. note:: For each SNP position, the ratio (r) is calculated as follows:

    r= dm / (dr + dm)

    - dr= Number of reads having the reference allele
    - dm= Number of reads having the mutated allele

The output file(s) of snpToolkit is a tabulated file(s) that you can open with Microsoft Excel and it will look as follow:

.. image:: images/snpToolkitHeader.png

The header of the generated snpToolkit output file includes useful information e.g. raw number of SNPs, Number of filtered SNPs, SNPs distribution, etc... 


*********************************************
Compare and combine multiple annotation files
*********************************************

After generating a set of output files, you can run ``snpToolkit combine``:
::

  usage: snpToolkit combine [-h] --location LOCATION [-r RATIO] [-d DEPTH]
                               [--bam BAMFOLDER] [--snps {ns,s,all,inter}]
  
  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  
  snpToolkit combine required options:
    --location LOCATION         provide the name of the locus you want to create
    						fasta alignment for
  
  snpToolkit additional options:
    -r RATIO              SNP ratio
    -d DEPTH              depth cutoff for cheking missing data
    --bam BAMFOLDER       path to the folder containing bam files
    --snps {ns,s,all,inter}
                          Specify if you want to concatenate all SNPs or just
                          synonymous (s), non-synonymous (ns) or intergenic
                          (inter) SNPs. default [all]
                          

``snpToolkit combine`` will compare all the SNPs identified in each file and create two additional output files: 

  1) a tabulated files with all polymorphic sites
  2) a ``fasta`` file. 

As we will be working with ancient DNA, a small fraction of your genome could be covered. In this case we will use the option ``--bam`` to indicate the path to the folder containing the ``bam`` files. 
The option ``-d`` must be used with the option ``--bam``. By default, all SNPs will be reported. This behaviour can be changed using the option ``--snp``.

.. note :: It is also possible to use the option ``--bam`` with modern data as some genomic regions could be deleted. 

The file reporting the polymorphic sites is organized as follows:

==== =========== === === ============================ ======= ======= ======= =======
ID   Coordinates REF SNP Columns with SNP information sample1 sample2 sample3 sample4
==== =========== === === ============================ ======= ======= ======= =======
snp1 130         A   T                                1       1       1       1
snp2 855         C   G                                0       0       ?       1
snp3 1315        A   C                                1       1       0       0
snp4 12086       G   A                                1       0       ?       0
==== =========== === === ============================ ======= ======= ======= =======
 
The table above reports the distribution of all polymorphic sites in all provided files. 
As we provided the ``bam`` files of the ancient DNA samples, snpToolkit will check if the polymorphic sites (snp2 and snp4) are absent in sample3 
because there is no SNP in that positions or because the region where the snps are located is not covered. In the latter case, snpToolkit will add a question mark ``?`` that reflects a missing data. 
From the table above, it will be possible to generate a ``fasta`` file, like the one below:
::

  >Reference
  ATCGGGTATGCCAATGCGT
  >Sample1
  ACCGGGTATGCCAATGTGT
  >Sample2
  ATTGGGTATGCCAGTGCGT
  >Sample3
  ?TTGAGT?TGTCA?TACGT
  >Sample4
  ATCGGGTATGCCAATGCGT


The ``fasta`` output file will be used to generate a maximum likelihood tree using ``IQ-TREE``


********************************
Phylogenetic tree reconstruction
********************************

There are several tools to build phylogenetic trees. All of these tools, use an alignment file as input file. Now that we have generated an alignment file in ``fasta`` format, we will use ``IQ-TREE`` to build a maximum likelihood tree. 
We use ``IQ-TREE`` for several reasons:

- It performs a composition chi-square test for every sequence in the alignment. A sequence is denoted failed if its character composition significantly deviates from the average composition of the alignment.

- Availability of a wide variety of phylogenetic models. ``IQ-TREE`` uses `ModelFinder`_ to find the best substitution model that will be used directly to build the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree.

- Multithreading 

    .. _ModelFinder: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28481363

The phylogenetic tree generated can be visualized using ``Figtree``.
